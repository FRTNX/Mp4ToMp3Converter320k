# Mp4ToMp3Converter320k
A tiny script that converts mp4 files to mp3, at a bitrate of 320kb :)

PowerTip: Move this file to /usr/local/bin, make it executable (chmod +x doit), and you'll be able to run the script from any folder. You're welcome.

## Instructions

Paste the script into a folder of mp4 files, run it by simply entering `bash doit`. The output will be placed in a subdirectory of the same name as the parent directory.
